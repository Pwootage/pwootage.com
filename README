The pwootage.com website
========================

Special thanks to veekeun ( http://veekun.com/ ) for creating/releasing
his awesome database of everything you could possibly want to know about
Pokémon, the Pokédex here wouldn't be possible without it

Original Pokédex repository:

My modified Pokédex repository with Play Framework binding generation code:

Pokémon, as well as many of the resources included in this project, are 
intellectual property of Nintendo and GAME FREAK, and are believed to
fall under fair use.
